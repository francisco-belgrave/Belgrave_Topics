    "\n",
    "## 1. Classical hypothesis testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Exploring the data from the NSFG, we saw several “apparent effects,” including differences between first babies and others. So far we have taken these effects at face value; in this chapter, we put them to the test.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental question we want to address is whether the effects we see in a sample are likely to appear in the larger population. For example, in the NSFG sample we see a difference in mean pregnancy length for first babies\n",
    "and others. We would like to know if that effect reflects a real difference for women in the U.S., or if it might appear in the sample by chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways we could formulate this question, including Fisher null hypothesis testing, Neyman-Pearson decision theory, and Bayesian inference. What I present here is a subset of all three that makes up most of what people use in practice, which I will call **classical hypothesis testing**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of classical hypothesis testing is to answer the question, “Given a sample and an apparent effect, what is the probability of seeing such an effect by chance?” Here’s how we answer that question:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first step is to quantify the size of the apparent effect by choosing a **test statistic**. In the NSFG example, the apparent effect is a difference in pregnancy length between first babies and others, so a natural choice for the test statistic is the difference in means between the two groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The second step is to define a **null hypothesis**, which is a model of the system based on the assumption that the apparent effect is not real. In the NSFG example the null hypothesis is that there is no difference between first babies and others; that is, that pregnancy lengths for both groups have the same distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The third step is to compute a **p-value**, which is the probability of seeing the apparent effect if the null hypothesis is true. In the NSFG example, we would compute the actual difference in means, then compute the probability of seeing a difference as big, or bigger, under the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The last step is to interpret the result. If the p-value is low, the effect is said to be **statistically significant**, which means that it is unlikely to have occurred by chance. In that case we infer that the effect is more likely to appear in the larger population.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Create a cram card asking the hypothesis testing process**\n",
    "\n",
    "The logic of this process is similar to a proof by contradiction. To prove a mathematical statement, A, you assume temporarily that A is false. If that assumption leads to a contradiction, you conclude that A must actually be\n",
    "true.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, to test a hypothesis like, “This effect is real,” we assume, temporarily, that it is not. That’s the null hypothesis. Based on that assumption, we compute the probability of the apparent effect. That’s the p-value. If the p-value is low, we conclude that the null hypothesis is unlikely to be true.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Hypothesis test\n",
