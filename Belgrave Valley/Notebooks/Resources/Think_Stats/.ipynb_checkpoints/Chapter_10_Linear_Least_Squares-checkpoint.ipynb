    "# Chapter 10 Linear least squares\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Least squares fit\n",
    "\n",
    "Correlation coefficients measure the strength and sign of a relationship, but not the slope. There are several ways to estimate the slope; the most common is a **linear least squares** fit. A “linear fit” is a line intended to model the relationship between variables. A “least squares” fit is one that minimizes the mean squared error (MSE) between the line and the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a sequence of points, ys, that we want to express as a function of another sequence xs. If there is a linear relationship between xs and ys with intercept inter and slope slope, we expect each y[i] to be inter + slope * x[i].\n",
    "\n",
    "But unless the correlation is perfect, this prediction is only approximate. The vertical deviation from the line, or **residual**, is\n",
    "\n",
    "res = ys - (inter + slope * xs)\n",
    "\n",
    "The residuals might be due to random factors like measurement error, or non-random factors that are unknown. For example, if we are trying to predict weight as a function of height, unknown factors might include diet, exercise,\n",
    "and body type.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we get the parameters inter and slope wrong, the residuals get bigger, so it makes intuitive sense that the parameters we want are the ones that minimize the residuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "We might try to minimize the absolute value of the residuals, or their squares, or their cubes; but the most common choice is to minimize the sum of squared residuals, sum(res**2)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Why? There are three good reasons and one less important one:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Squaring has the feature of treating positive and negative residuals the same, which is usually what we want.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Squaring gives more weight to large residuals, but not so much weight that the largest residual always dominates.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the residuals are uncorrelated and normally distributed with mean 0 and constant (but unknown) variance, then the least squares fit is also the maximum likelihood estimator of inter and slope. See https: //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The values of inter and slope that minimize the squared residuals can be computed efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last reason made sense when computational efficiency was more important than choosing the method most appropriate to the problem at hand. That’s no longer the case, so it is worth considering whether squared residuals are the right thing to minimize.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you are using xs to predict values of ys, guessing too high might be better (or worse) than guessing too low. In that case you might want to compute some cost function for each residual, and minimize total\n",
    "cost, sum(cost(res)). However, computing a least squares fit is quick, easy and often good enough.\n",

In fact, because R 2 = ρ 2 , a one-sided test of R 2 is equivalent to a two-sided test of ρ.
