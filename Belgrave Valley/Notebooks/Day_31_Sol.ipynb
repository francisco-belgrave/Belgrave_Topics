    "The linear least squares fit in the previous chapter is an example of **regression**, which is the more general problem of fitting any kind of model to any kind of data. This use of the term “regression” is a historical accident; it is\n",

If there is more than one dependent variable, that’s multivariate regression.\n",

The computation is similar to `thinkstats2.LeastSquare`, but generalized to deal with more than one explanatory variable. You can find the details at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_least_squares."
