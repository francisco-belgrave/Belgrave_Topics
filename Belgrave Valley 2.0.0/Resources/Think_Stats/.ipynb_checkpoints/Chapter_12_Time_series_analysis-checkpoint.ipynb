    "A **time series** is a sequence of measurements from a system that varies in time. One famous example is the “hockey stick graph” that shows global average temperature over time (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hockey_stick_graph)\n",
    "\n",
    "The example I work with in this chapter comes from Zachary M. Jones, a researcher in political science who studies the black market for cannabis in the U.S. (http://zmjones.com/marijuana). He collected data from a web site called “Price of Weed” that crowdsources market information by asking participants to report the price, quantity, quality, and location of cannabis transactions (http://www.priceofweed.com/). The goal of his project is to investigate the effect of policy decisions, like legalization, on markets. I find this project appealing because it is an example that uses data to address important political questions, like drug policy.\n",
