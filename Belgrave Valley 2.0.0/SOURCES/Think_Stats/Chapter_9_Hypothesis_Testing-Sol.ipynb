    "\n",
    "## 1. Classical hypothesis testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Exploring the data from the NSFG, we saw several “apparent effects,” including differences between first babies and others. So far we have taken these effects at face value; in this chapter, we put them to the test.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental question we want to address is whether the effects we see in a sample are likely to appear in the larger population. For example, in the NSFG sample we see a difference in mean pregnancy length for first babies\n",
    "and others. We would like to know if that effect reflects a real difference for women in the U.S., or if it might appear in the sample by chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways we could formulate this question, including Fisher null hypothesis testing, Neyman-Pearson decision theory, and Bayesian inference. What I present here is a subset of all three that makes up most of what people use in practice, which I will call **classical hypothesis testing**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of classical hypothesis testing is to answer the question, “Given a sample and an apparent effect, what is the probability of seeing such an effect by chance?” Here’s how we answer that question:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first step is to quantify the size of the apparent effect by choosing a **test statistic**. In the NSFG example, the apparent effect is a difference in pregnancy length between first babies and others, so a natural choice for the test statistic is the difference in means between the two groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The second step is to define a **null hypothesis**, which is a model of the system based on the assumption that the apparent effect is not real. In the NSFG example the null hypothesis is that there is no difference between first babies and others; that is, that pregnancy lengths for both groups have the same distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The third step is to compute a **p-value**, which is the probability of seeing the apparent effect if the null hypothesis is true. In the NSFG example, we would compute the actual difference in means, then compute the probability of seeing a difference as big, or bigger, under the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The last step is to interpret the result. If the p-value is low, the effect is said to be **statistically significant**, which means that it is unlikely to have occurred by chance. In that case we infer that the effect is more likely to appear in the larger population.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Create a cram card asking the hypothesis testing process**\n",
    "\n",
    "The logic of this process is similar to a proof by contradiction. To prove a mathematical statement, A, you assume temporarily that A is false. If that assumption leads to a contradiction, you conclude that A must actually be\n",
    "true.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, to test a hypothesis like, “This effect is real,” we assume, temporarily, that it is not. That’s the null hypothesis. Based on that assumption, we compute the probability of the apparent effect. That’s the p-value. If the p-value is low, we conclude that the null hypothesis is unlikely to be true.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Hypothesis test\n",

    "The result is about 70%, which means that if the actual difference in mean pregnancy length is 0.078 weeks, we expect an experiment with this sample size to yield a negative test 70% of the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "This result is often presented the other way around: if the actual difference is 0.078 weeks, we should expect a positive test only 30% of the time. This “correct positive rate” is called the **power** of the test, or sometimes “sensitivity”. It reflects the ability of the test to detect an effect of a given size.\n",

    "The hypothesis testing process I demonstrated in this chapter is not, strictly speaking, good practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, I performed multiple tests. If you run one hypothesis test, the chance of a false positive is about 1 in 20, which might be acceptable. But if you run 20 tests, you should expect at least one false positive, most of the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, I used the same dataset for exploration and testing. If you explore a large dataset, find a surprising effect, and then test whether it is significant, you have a good chance of generating a false positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "To compensate for multiple tests, you can adjust the p-value threshold (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holm-Bonferroni_method). Or you can address both problems by partitioning the data, using one set for exploration\n",
    "and the other for testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some fields these practices are required or at least encouraged. But it is also common to address these problems implicitly by replicating published results. Typically the first paper to report a new result is considered ex-\n",
    "ploratory. Subsequent papers that replicate the result with new data are considered confirmatory.\n",
    "\n",
    "As it happens, we have an opportunity to replicate the results in this chapter.\n",
    "The first edition of this book is based on Cycle 6 of the NSFG, which was\n",
    "released in 2002. In October 2011, the CDC released additional data based\n",
    "on interviews conducted from 2006–2010. nsfg2.py contains code to read\n",
    "and clean this data. In the new dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The difference in mean pregnancy length is 0.16 weeks and statistically significant with p < 0.001 (compared to 0.078 weeks in the original dataset).\n",
    "- The difference in birth weight is 0.17 pounds with p < 0.001 (compared to 0.12 lbs in the original dataset).\n",
    "- The correlation between birth weight and mother’s age is 0.08 with p < 0.001 (compared to 0.07).\n",
    "- The chi-squared test is statistically significant with p < 0.001 (as it was in the original).\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, all of the effects that were statistically significant in the original dataset were replicated in the new dataset, and the difference in pregnancy length, which was not significant in the original, is bigger in the new dataset and significant."
