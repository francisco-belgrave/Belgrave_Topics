    "The linear least squares fit in the previous chapter is an example of **regression**, which is the more general problem of fitting any kind of model to any kind of data. This use of the term “regression” is a historical accident; it is\n",
    "only indirectly related to the original meaning of the word.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of regression analysis is to describe the relationship between one set of variables, called the **dependent variables**, and another set of variables, called independent or **explanatory variables**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous chapter we used mother’s age as an explanatory variable to predict birth weight as a dependent variable. When there is only one dependent and one explanatory variable, that’s **simple regression**. In this chapter, we move on to multiple regression, with more than one explanatory variable. If there is more than one dependent variable, that’s multivariate regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the relationship between the dependent and explanatory variable is linear, that’s linear regression. For example, if the dependent variable is y and the explanatory variables are x 1 and x 2 , we would write the following linear regression model:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](notebookpics/regression.png \"Title\")\n",
    "\n",
    "where β0 is the intercept, β1 is the parameter associated with x 1 , β 2 is the parameter associated with x 2 , and ε is the residual due to random variation or other unknown factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a sequence of values for y and sequences for x 1 and x 2 , we can find the parameters, β 0 , β 1 , and β 2 , that minimize the sum of ε2. This process is called ordinary least squares. The computation is similar to thinkstats2.LeastSquare, but generalized to deal with more than one explanatory variable. You can find the details at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_least_squares.\n",

    "In the previous chapter I presented thinkstats2.LeastSquares, an implementation of simple linear regression intended to be easy to read. For multiple regression we’ll switch to StatsModels, a Python package that provides\n",
    "several forms of regression and other analyses. If you are using Anaconda, you already have StatsModels; otherwise you might have to install it.\n",

    "As an example of logistic regression, let’s consider a variation on the office pool scenario. Suppose a friend of yours is pregnant and you want to predict whether the baby is a boy or a girl. You could use data from the NSFG to\n",
    "find factors that affect the “sex ratio”, which is conventionally defined to be the probability of having a boy.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you encode the dependent variable numerically, for example 0 for a girl and 1 for a boy, you could apply ordinary least squares, but there would be problems. The linear model might be something like this:\n",

    "![alt text](notebookpics/logformula.png \"Title\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Where y is the dependent variable, and x 1 and x 2 are explanatory variables. Then we could find the parameters that minimize the residuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with this approach is that it produces predictions that are hard to interpret. Given estimated parameters and values for x 1 and x 2 , the model might predict y = 0.5, but the only meaningful values of y are 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is tempting to interpret a result like that as a probability; for example, we might say that a respondent with particular values of x 1 and x 2 has a 50% chance of having a boy. But it is also possible for this model to predict y = 1.1 or y = −0.1, and those are not valid probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression avoids this problem by expressing predictions in terms of odds rather than probabilities. If you are not familiar with odds, “odds in favor” of an event is the ratio of the probability it will occur to the probability that it will not.\n",
