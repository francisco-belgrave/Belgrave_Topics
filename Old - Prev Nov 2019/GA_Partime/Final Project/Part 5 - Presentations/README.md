### PROMPT

This is it! It's presentation time.

Whether during an interview or as part of a job, you will frequently have to present your findings to business partners and other interested parties - many of whom won't know anything about data science. That's why it's important to practice communicating your work clearly and effectively - for any audience.

Your goal is to create a 7 minute presentation that guides a non-technical audience through your problem, data, hypothesis, findings, and results. You should already have the analytical work complete, so now it's time to clean up and clarify your findings. 

Create a detailed 10-20 slide deck or interactive demo that explains your data, visualizes your model, describes your approach, articulates strengths and weaknesses, and presents specific recommendations. Plan for a 7 minute presentation with 1-2 minutes of QA; be prepared to explain and defend your model to an inquisitive audience!

**Goal:** A detailed 10-20 slide presentation deck that relates your data, model, and findings to a non-technical audience.

### DELIVERABLES

#### Final Presentation
**Requirements:**

  * Show off your work to what would be a less technical, more business oriented audience
  * Summarize the work you've completed from earlier deliverables into a clean presentation, including:
    * Your project's background, problem and hypothesis
    * Descriptions of the datasets you used
    * Data exploration with summary and charts
    * An explanation of your model (for non-technical audiences)
    * Recommendations based on your findings
    * An appendix that includes all of your work and technical terminology
  * Review next steps with your audience; what could you do beyond the scope of this course?

**Detailed Breakdown:**
A 10 to 20 slide deck consisting of:

 * *1 Outline Slide*
   - What is your project about?
   - What is its history?
   - What relevant information is required for a colleague to jump in to understand your project?
 * *2-3 Summary Slides* (including data and problem statement)
   - What were you trying to accomplish?
   - What steps did your project take?
   - Where did the data come from? What does a sample look like? Was there data you considered but decided to remove?
 * *3-4 Modeling Insight Slides*
   - What is the visualization explaining?
   - What do the x and y axes mean?
   - How does the visualization help either prove or disprove your work?
   - What caveats have to be explained to best understand it?
 * *2-3 Modeling Approach Slides*
   - What was your model trying to optimize for? Why was it the right metric for optimization?
   - What algorithm did you try? How does it work?  
 * *2-3 Results Slides*
   - What worked? What didn't? Why?
 * *1-2 Conclusion Slides*
   - What had the most impact on your work?
   - What can you confirm? What can you suggest? What is still to be determined?
 * *1-2 Next Steps Slides*
   - What should this project do moving forward?
   - What would be the next two or three things you want to try? What impact might they have?
   - What might your conclusions enable others to do?

**Bonus:**

  * An Acknowledgements Slide is always a good idea :)
  * You might also include a Citations Slide, if necessary

### RESOURCES

#### Suggestions for Getting Started

- A quick outline (e.g. "what do I need" and "where can I find it") can help you prepare.
- Practice your presentation with a friend or family member! Outside feedback can help you identify gaps in your material.

#### Specific Tips

- Limit the amount of visuals and text on your slides for maximum clarity.
    - For instance, try not to use more than 2 visuals or 3-5 bullets per slide.
- Clean & informative presentations > Fancy Presentations!
- Keep your charts simple, and make sure they are clearly labeled.
