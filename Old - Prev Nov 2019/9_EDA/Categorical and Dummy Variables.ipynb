    "\n",
    "Regression analysis is used with numerical variables. Results only have a valid\n",
    "interpretation if it makes sense to assume that having a value of 2 on some variable\n",
    "is does indeed mean having twice as much of something as a 1, and having a 50 means\n",
    "50 times as much as 1. But, some times you need to work with categorical variables\n",
    "in which the different values have no real numerical relationship with each other.\n",
    "The solution is, to use categorical and dummy variables\n",
    "\n",
    "A categorical variable is an independent or predictor variable that contains\n",
    "values indicating membership in one of several possible categories. E.g.,\n",
    "gender (male or female), marital status (married, single, divorced,\n",
    "widowed). The categories are often assigned numerical values used as\n",
    "labels, e.g., 0 = male; 1 = female.\n",
    "\n",
    "A dummy variable is created by recoding categorial variables that have more than\n",
    "two categories into a series of binary variables.\n",

    "Here is more information on different [types of variables](http://www.indiana.edu/~educy520/sec5982/week_2/variable_types.pdf).\n",

    "## Demo / Guided Practice: Categorical Variables \n",
    "\n",
    "Why exactly would you want to use categorical variables?\n",
    "The categorical data type is useful in the following cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A string variable consisting of only a few different values. Converting such a\n",
    "    string variable to a categorical variable will save some memory, see  \n",
    "    [here](https://pandas-docs.github.io/pandas-docs-travis/categorical.html#categorical-memory).\n",
    "- The lexical order of a variable is not the same as the logical order (“one”, “two”, “three”). By converting to a \n",
    "    categorical and specifying an order on the categories, sorting and min/max will\n",
    "    use the logical order instead of the lexical order, see\n",
    "    [here](https://pandas-docs.github.io/pandas-docs-travis/categorical.html#categorical-sort)\n",
    "- As a signal to other python libraries that this column should be treated as a\n",
    "    categorical variable (e.g. to use suitable statistical methods or plot types).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use pandas to create a few Categorical Series. One way is by specifying\n",
    "dtype=\"category\" when constructing a Series:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Here is a link to the [demo code](./w2-3.3-demo.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "s = pd.Series([\"a\",\"b\",\"c\",\"a\"], dtype=\"category\")\n",
    "s\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way is to convert an existing Series or column to a category dtype:\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "df = pd.DataFrame({\"A\":[\"a\",\"b\",\"c\",\"a\"]})\n",
    "df[\"B\"] = df[\"A\"].astype('category')\n",
    "df\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also pass a pandas.Categorical object to a Series or assign it to a DataFrame.\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "raw_cat = pd.Categorical([\"a\",\"b\",\"c\",\"a\"], categories=[\"b\",\"c\",\"d\"],\n",
    "                          ordered=False)\n",

    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, a dummy variable is created by recoding categorial variables that\n",
    "have more than two categories into a series of binary variables.\n",
    "E.g., Marital status, if originally labelled 1=married, 2=single, and 3=divorced,\n",
    "widowed, or separated, could be redefined in terms of two variables as follows:\n",
    "var_1: 1=single, 0=otherwise. Var_2: 1=divorced, widowed, or separated, 0=otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use pd.get_dummies to convert categorical variables into dummy variables.\n",

    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "df = pd.DataFrame({'key': list('bbacab'), 'data1': range(6)})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's convert the categorical variables into dummy variables.\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "pd.get_dummies(df['key'])\n",
