    "This book has focused on computational methods like simulation and resampling, but some of the problems we solved have analytic solutions that can be much faster.\n",

    "I present some of these methods in this chapter, and explain how they work. At the end of the chapter, I make suggestions for integrating computational and analytic methods for exploratory data analysis.\n",

    "## 1. Normal Distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "As a motivating example, let’s review the problem section 3 chapter 8:\n",
    "\n",
    "`Suppose you are a scientist studying gorillas in a wildlife preserve. Having weighed 9 gorillas, you find sample mean x̄ = 90 kg and sample standard deviation, S = 7.5 kg. If you use x̄ to estimate the population mean, what is the standard error of the estimate?`\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer that question, we need the sampling distribution of x̄. In Section 8.3 we approximated this distribution by simulating the experiment (weighing 9 gorillas), computing x̄ for each simulated experiment, and accumulating the distribution of estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is an approximation of the sampling distribution. Then we use the sampling distribution to compute standard errors and confidence intervals:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The standard deviation of the sampling distribution is the standard error of the estimate; in the example, it is about 2.5 kg.\n",
    "2. The interval between the 5th and 95th percentile of the sampling distribution is a 90% confidence interval. If we run the experiment many times, we expect the estimate to fall in this interval 90% of the time. In the example, the 90% CI is (86, 94) kg.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we’ll do the same calculation analytically. We take advantage of the fact that the weights of adult female gorillas are roughly normally distributed. Normal distributions have two properties that make them amenable for analysis: they are “closed” under linear transformation and addition. To explain what that means, I need some notation.\n",

    "This result is the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). It is one of the most useful tools for statistical analysis, but it comes with caveats:\n",
    "- The values have to be drawn independently. If they are correlated, the CLT doesn’t apply (although this is seldom a problem in practice).\n",
    "- The values have to come from the same distribution (although this requirement can be relaxed).\n",
    "- The values have to be drawn from a distribution with finite mean and variance. So most Pareto distributions are out.\n",
    "- The rate of convergence depends on the skewness of the distribution. Sums from an exponential distribution converge for small n. Sums from a lognormal distribution require larger sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Central Limit Theorem explains the prevalence of normal distributions in the natural world. Many characteristics of living things are affected by genetic and environmental factors whose effect is additive. The characteristics we measure are the sum of a large number of small effects, so their distribution tends to be normal.\n",

    "This book focuses on computational methods like resampling and permutation. These methods have several advantages over analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "- They are easier to explain and understand. For example, one of the most difficult topics in an introductory statistics class is hypothesis testing. Many students don’t really understand what p-values are. I think the approach I presented in Chapter 9—simulating the null hypothesis and computing test statistics—makes the fundamental idea clearer.\n",
    "- They are robust and versatile. Analytic methods are often based on assumptions that might not hold in practice. Computational methods require fewer assumptions, and can be adapted and extended more easily.\n",
    "- They are debuggable. Analytic methods are often like a black box: you plug in numbers and they spit out results. But it’s easy to make subtle errors, hard to be confident that the results are right, and hard to find the problem if they are not. Computational methods lend themselves to incremental development and testing, which fosters confidence in the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "But there is one drawback: computational methods can be slow. Taking into account these pros and cons, I recommend the following process:\n",
    "1. Use computational methods during exploration. If you find a satisfactory answer and the run time is acceptable, you can stop.\n",
    "2. If run time is not acceptable, look for opportunities to optimize. Using analytic methods is one of several methods of optimization.\n",
    "3. If replacing a computational method with an analytic method is appropriate, use the computational method as a basis of comparison, providing mutual validation between the computational and analytic results.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the vast majority of problems I have worked on, I didn’t have to go past Step 1."

    "In Section 5.4, we saw that the distribution of adult weights is approximately lognormal. One possible explanation is that the weight a person gains each year is proportional to their current weight. In that case, adult weight is the product of a large number of multiplicative factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "w = w0 f1 f2 ... fn  \n",
    "\n",
    "where w is adult weight, w0 is birth weight, and fi is the weight gain factor for year i.\n",

    "logw = logw0 + logf1 + logf2 + ... + logfn \n",
    "\n",
    "So by the Central Limit Theorem, the distribution of logw is approximately normal for large n, which implies that the distribution of w is lognormal.\n",
    "\n",
    "To model this phenomenon, choose a distribution for f that seems reasonable, then generate a sample of adult weights by choosing a random value from the distribution of birth weights, choosing a sequence of factors from the distribution of f, and computing the product. What value of n is needed to converge to a lognormal distribution?"
